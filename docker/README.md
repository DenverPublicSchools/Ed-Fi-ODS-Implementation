# Docker for the ODS/API Platform

This directory contains dockerfiles and related scripts, as needed, for the
official binary release images of the ODS / API platform.

As appropriate, these images are built from the same NuGet packages that are
distributed as the "binary release" of the platform. This source repository also
includes dockerfiles that build from source code. These are intended for
end-to-end and local testing, not for distribution.

The [Ed-Fi-ODS-Docker](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-ODS-Docker)
continues to hold more complex Docker Compose scripts that also demonstrate
loading tools from other repositories.
